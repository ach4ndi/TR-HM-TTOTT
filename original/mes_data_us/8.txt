<PAGE>If you let your animals out
into the outside yard, they

will get stressed if you
let them out.<PAGE>So on rainy days, feed your
animals by putting fodder
in the feed box.<PAGE>If you have fodder in
storage, you can get it out
of the dispenser.</COLOR><PAGE>Also, cows and sheep will
get dirty if you don't
brush them <RED>every day.<PAGE>If you let your animals stay
dirty, they can <RED>get sick</COLOR>.<PAGE>So make sure to brush them
once a day.<PAGE>If you take good care of
them every day...<PAGE>you'll be able to get milk,
wool, and eggs from your

Stamina, so pay close
attention to it.<PAGE>If you use up all your
Stamina, you'll pass out and
wake up the next day.<PAGE>Of course, farming takes
a lot of Stamina!<PAGE>When you're taking care of
a big farm, you can
never have enough Stamina...<PAGE>The best thing to do to
is to eat lots of delicious
food to restore Stamina.<PAGE>The amount of Stamina you

dishes to find which dishes
give you the most Stamina!

Greetings, ladies and
gentlemen. I'm Felicia,
world-famous cat fancier.<PAGE>My beloved cat Isis and I
have taken up the pen to
share with you all<PAGE>just how to care for your
own beloved felines.
<PAGE>Of course I'll cover
dogs as well...<PAGE>Hee hee. So first off,
what's the most important<PAGE>thing when it comes to
caring for cats and dogs?<PAGE>Physical contact. You need
to hold your pet at least
once every day.<PAGE>It's very simple to do.
All you need to do is pick
your pet up.<PAGE>You can also play with your
pet using toys.<PAGE>Just buy a <RED>cat bell</COLOR> for
your cat and a <RED>dog bone</COLOR> for
your dog.<PAGE>Throw the toy near your pet,
and they'll play happily
with it.<PAGE>Your pets love to play, so
you should play with them
as often as you're able to.<PAGE>There are also pet playpens
that you can build for your
pets to play in.<PAGE>Build a strong bond with
your pet, and you'll have a
friend for life.<PAGE>Of course Isis doesn't, but
some pets will help you out
on the farm.<PAGE>You can learn about those
pets in the book in the
<RED>animal barn</COLOR>.<PAGE>Now, I've never had one
myself, but...
<PAGE>I've heard that some people
keep owls as pets.<PAGE>Just don't forget that no
matter what kind of pet you
have, physical contact is<PAGE>the most important way to
show them you care.<PAGE>Now, about feeding your pet.
<PAGE>I won't say much, but just
remember to feed your pet
once every single day.<PAGE>And that's all I can tell
you about caring for
your pets.<PAGE>All I want is for people
to love their pets with all
their hearts. Good bye!

Do you know about all the
wonders of the mountains?
Well then, let me tell you!<PAGE>In the mountains, you can
catch all different types of
bugs and fish.<PAGE>You can also forage for
plants and other items!<PAGE>To pick up a bug, get close
and press the <RED>A Button</COLOR>.<PAGE>You'll also need to jump to
catch some bugs. It can be
tricky!<PAGE>Some bugs are very sensitive
to noise, so you have to<PAGE><RED>walk slowly</COLOR> when you
approach them.<PAGE>Now let me tell you how to
catch fish. There are 2 ways
to catch fish.<PAGE>You can hand fish by
approaching a fish in a<PAGE>shallow river and pressing
the <RED>A Button</COLOR> to grab it.<PAGE>If you're the patient type,
you might prefer fishing
with your rod off a dock.<PAGE>Wait patiently, and once you
feel a fish bite, press the
<RED>A Button</COLOR> as fast as you can.<PAGE>However, some fish can only
be caught by hand fishing,
and some only with a rod.<PAGE>If you want to try and catch
every kind of fish out
there, master both!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
You can also forage for
all sorts of things on
the mountain.<PAGE>Just look around, and you
can find valuable plants and
other interesting things.<PAGE>And now I'm going to let you
in on a little secret!<PAGE>I found beautiful flowers
and ore in the <RED>crevices

<CHOICE_ABC> The basics of requests
 Levels and rankings
 Don't read it.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
To fulfill a request, first
examine the <RED>message board</COLOR>.<PAGE>Both Bluebell and Konohana
have a message board.<PAGE>The boards are posted with
<RED>requests</COLOR> for help or favors
by members of that village.<PAGE>Chose the request you want
to fulfill, and give the
requested item to the<PAGE>requester within
the posted <RED>timeframe</COLOR>.<PAGE>When you give the requester
their requested item, you<PAGE>can <RED>give them items from
your cart</COLOR> if it's nearby.<PAGE>Not all requests are for
items. Some people request
help with various jobs...<PAGE>And pay attention, because
sometimes people post<PAGE>requests to be fulfilled for
other people.<PAGE>Even if you are unable to
fulfill a request before the<PAGE>deadline, there is no
penalty for failed requests.<PAGE>So try to take on requests
even if you're not confident
that you will succeed. <PAGE>If you succeed in fulfilling
a request, you'll get
a fantastic <RED>reward</COLOR>!<PAGE>However, if your bag is full
when you get your reward...<PAGE>You'll have to get rid of
items in your bag to
accept the reward.<PAGE>Make sure to make some <RED>room
in your bag</COLOR> before you
fulfill a request.<PAGE>Or bring along a cart with
plenty of room left.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
If you've fulfilled a lot of
requests, you will go to
the next <RED>request level</COLOR>.<PAGE>When your request level goes
up...<PAGE>You'll be able to take on
higher-ranking requests.
<PAGE>The <RED>rank</COLOR> shows just
how difficult a request is.
<PAGE>There are 5 different ranks:
D, C, B, A, and S.
<PAGE>Basically, the higher rank
a request is, the harder
it will be to fulfill.<PAGE>And the more difficult
the request.<PAGE>High-ranked requests
give you the chance to
earn rare items...<PAGE>So try and fulfill a lot of
requests so you can attempt
the high-ranked requests.<PAGE>As your request level goes
up, so does the number of
requests you can take on.<PAGE>In the beginning, you can
only take on 10 requests at
a time.<PAGE>But when you get to a higher
rank, you can take on more
requests at a time.<PAGE>However, once you accept a
request, you can't
cancel it.<PAGE>So be careful not to take on
so many requests that you
can't accept any more.

till the land.<PAGE>When you've tilled the land,
sow your <RED>seeds</COLOR>.<PAGE>Each type of seed can only
be sown during a certain

the wrong season.<PAGE>Once you've sown your seeds,
use a <RED>watering can</COLOR> to water
them.<PAGE>Your crops will grow as long
as you water them carefully
every single day.<PAGE>They'll grow better if you
water them twice a day.<PAGE>To do that, water them early
in the morning, then again
later in the day.<PAGE>However, caring for your
crops uses Stamina...<PAGE>So make sure to keep an eye
on your Stamina Bar.<PAGE>If you use all your Stamina,
you'll pass out and wake up
the next day.<PAGE>Of course, farming takes
a lot of stamina!<PAGE>When you're taking care of
your crops, you can
never have enough Stamina...<PAGE>The best thing to do to
is to eat lots of delicious
food to restore Stamina.<PAGE>The amount of Stamina you
gain depends on the food
you eat.<PAGE>Food made with a large
variety of good quality
ingredients gives you more.<PAGE>So try cooking different
dishes to find which dishes
give you the most Stamina!

If you want to raise the
quality of crops, use
<RED>fertilizer</COLOR> before you sow.<PAGE>To use fertilizer, just
equip it like you would
any other item.<PAGE>When you use the fertilizer,
the area around you will
be fertilized.<PAGE>Let me try to make a
diagram for you despite
my poor drawing skills:<PAGE>\u232f■■■
■❤■
■■■\u232c<PAGE>The ❤ is fertilizer, and
■ is the area that gets
fertilized.<PAGE>The more fertilizer you use,
the more effective it is.<PAGE>If you put fertilizer on
both sides of a spot,<PAGE>the crops in that trench
will get the fertilizer
from both sides. Like this:<PAGE>\u232f■★■■
❤★❤■
■★■■\u232c<PAGE>★ is a trench getting the
effects of two fertilizers.
<PAGE>If you grow crops that way,
The ★ crops will be higher
quality than the ■ crops.<PAGE>So if you want to raise the
quality of your crops, plant
lots of fertilizer by them.<PAGE>If you plant fertilizer in
a field with irrigation<PAGE>trenches, the entire field
will get fertilized.<PAGE>You should try it.

arranging?<PAGE>Just leave it to me!
Putting together a lovely

red? White? Or even blue?
<PAGE>Beginners often think its

make a bouquet of different
flowers of the <RED>same color</COLOR>.<PAGE>For example, a bouquet of
only red and pink flowers
looks just adorable.<PAGE>A bouquet of all white
flowers looks very pure.
<PAGE>And a bouquet of blue
flowers... Well, why don't
you see for yourself?<PAGE>Once you've mastered single-

more colors in!<PAGE>Did this advice help you?
Maybe if you work hard, you
