<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>She was born when I was
only 5 years old.
<PAGE>And I've ridden her ever
since!<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>I reckon she's the best
friend I've got.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_LEFT>That fool Kana from Konohana
can't hold a candle to us!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>Oh, sorry. I get a little
hot under the collar when
it comes to that fella.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_LEFT>He runs the ranch over in
Konohana.<PAGE>We've got a bit of a rivalry
going. We're always arguing
about our horses.<PAGE>Why, the other day, he
said that his horse was
cuter than Dakota!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_LEFT>Now I know there's no horse
in the wide world as cute
as my Dakota!<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Isn't the right,
Dakota?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Who cares?
 She really is cute.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>What now?
Did you say something?
I couldn't...HEY!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>Dakota!
What's gotten into you!?
Now stop that, y'hear?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>Now why would you
go wild like that?
Calm down.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>Oh, I'm sorry . I can't
imagine what got into her.
I'm going to put her inside.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>See you later, <MYNAME>.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Oh! Dakota?
<PAGE>Why, she's taken a real
shine to you, <MYNAME>.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>You've really got a way
with animals.
<PAGE>I guess that's to be
expected for a farmer.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I surely am glad I invited
you over, <MYNAME>.<PAGE>I hope you'll come and visit
Dakota again soon.<PAGE>I know she'd like that!
