<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You're going to save it?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Hey, w-wait!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>It's wearing a collar.
It must be lost.

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Everything's going to be
all right. Don't cry.<PAGE>Hey, will you help me
find its owner,
<MYNAME>?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks!<PAGE>First, let's ask around, and
see if anyone knows anything
about this cat.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>A lost cat?<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>Hmm... I feel like I've
seen that cat around here
before...<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>Sorry... I can't remember
anything more than that...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>It's OK. Sorry to bother
you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Oh, don't worry about it!
I hope you guys are able
to find its owner!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>All right, let's go ask
someone else.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>I reckon I've seen that
cat somewhere before...<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>But I can't rightly remember
where...<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I've got a hunch it was
with one of our regulars
at our shop.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Really...?<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I reckon so. I'll let y'all
know if I remember anything
else.<PAGE>I'd be glad to look after it
for a while if y'all need.
Just say the word!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks a lot. We will.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>*sigh*... The search isn't
going so well...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>What'll happen to this
cat if we can't find
its owner?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Let's put it back...
 We can't give up now!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>Put it back...? You mean
leave it by the river
where we found it?<PAGE>That's horrible! What
kind of cold, uncaring
person are you?!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>Never mind.
I'll find the owner
myself.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Here, come with me...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>Sorry I dragged you
into this.<PAGE>See you.

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>You're right...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHOCK><FP_RIGHT>You know, just hearing you
say that, I think everything
will be all right.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
Nico! Here, Nico!
Where are you...?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
Oh! It's you,
Nico!<PAGE>Thank goodness! You had
me worried there!<PAGE>You chased off after that
bug and disappeared! I've
been looking everywhere!<PAGE>Well, I'm just glad that
you're all right!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
Were you kids looking
after him?
<PAGE>Thank you very much!
I'm Nico's owner.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
Oh dear! If we don't hurry,
Nico and I will miss our
ride out of town!<PAGE>I wanted to thank you
somehow, but I don't have
the time now. I'm sorry...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh no, don't worry about
it. We're just glad we
found his owner.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
What nice kids you are!
You'll have to excuse me,
then. I have to go.<PAGE>Let's go, Nico!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
Oh! Nico thanked you, too!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHOCK><FP_RIGHT>Oh, uh...
You're...welcome?

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>...\u270a\u270aWell, that was a bit
of an adventure.<PAGE>All's well that ends
well, I guess.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>A-Anyway...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I'm so glad you were
with me, <MYNAME>...<PAGE>You said everything would be
all right, and it was...
