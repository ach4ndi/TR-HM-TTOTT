<FACE_POS_LEFT><HIDE_NAME><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT><HIDE_FACE>Dum-Da-Da-DAA!
Good morning,
<MYNAME>!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><HIDE_NAME><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>How are you getting used to
life here, <MYNAME>?
I came to ask a favor.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><HIDE_NAME><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Huh? How do I know
your name?<PAGE>I know just about everything
important, silly.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Let me introduce myself. I'm
the <BLUE>Harvest Goddess</COLOR>!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>So, about that favor...
<PAGE>You know that the mayors of
Bluebell and Konohana don't
get along, right?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>It's not that they have any
good reason to dislike each
other...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I guess you could say it's
a tradition.<PAGE>The mayors of the two
villages have hated each
other for generations...<PAGE>But it wasn't always that
way.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>They used to get along so
well...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FP_LEFT>What did you say!?
Are you trying to insult
my village's cooking!?<PAGE>You can take your idiotic
opinion right back to
Konohana!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FP_RIGHT>I'm not trying to insult
Bluebell. I'm just saying
our cooking is better!<PAGE>If you can't see that, then
you're the one who's an
idiot!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
M-Mayors, please calm down!

----------------------------|----------------------------------
\u20d1Shut up!
You all just be quiet!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FP_RIGHT>Wh-What's that?
<PAGE>Looks like we startled
the bats!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>Hey, you two! Keep it down!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>I'm not putting up with all
this shouting! I need my
beauty sleep, you know!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>If you two hate each other
so much, I'll just close
this tunnel!<PAGE>Now you won't have to see
each other at all!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>\u20d1Oomph!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FP_LEFT>Wh-What's happening!?
Is it an earthquake?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FP_RIGHT>Y-Your yelling has angered
the Harvest Goddess!

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FP_LEFT>What!? You were yelling
a lot louder than I was!

----------------------------|----------------------------------
This isn't the time to be
arguing!
<PAGE>We have to get out of here
before it gets worse...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And there you have it.
I was so mad, I closed up
the tunnel!<PAGE>But now I feel kind of bad
about it.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>But it's a lot of work to
put it all back like it was.
\u270a\u270a<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And that's why...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I want you to do it for me,
<MYNAME>!<RED>‚ù§</COLOR>
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>But if you just reopen the
tunnel, they'll start
fighting again.<PAGE>So get them to be friends
first, okay?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>4 times a month they hold a
<RED>Cooking Festival</COLOR> on the top
of the mountain.<PAGE>I think that would be
your best bet.<PAGE>It's the only time the two
villages get together.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>If you can cook something
delicious and help your
village win, I'm sure...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>that the Mayors will see how
great both villages are and
become friends!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I'm counting on you!
Toodles!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT><HIDE_FACE>There used to be a tunnel
connecting the two villages.<PAGE>People traveled between the
villages all the time.<PAGE>But then the fighting
started...
