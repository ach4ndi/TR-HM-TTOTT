<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>This spring has such a
mysterious atmosphere about
it...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I wonder if some sacred
presence dwells here.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Speaking of mysteries...<PAGE>At the town hall I heard the
girls relating the legend
of the church bell.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>It seems there is a church
on the outskirts of Bluebell
Village.<PAGE>The church bell was once
used to ring out the time,
weddings, and so on.<PAGE>But it became decrepit and
fell into disuse for some
time...<PAGE>And yet, even though the
church was abandoned...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Couples who got married atop
the mountain sometimes heard
the sound of the bell...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>They said it was a sign
of the Harvest Goddess
giving her blessing...<PAGE>Now legend says if a couple
marry atop the mountain and
hear the bell ring...<PAGE>They'll be happy forever...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Those girls certainly have
a vivid imagination!
It's a charming fancy.<PAGE>What do you think of this
tale, <MYNAME>?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> It's wonderful!
 Fairytales mean nothing.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>You think so?
Just the sort of girl I
thought you were, then!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>On that subject...do you
have anyone you are hoping
to marry someday?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>No?
I am glad to hear that.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>In that case, I hope...
...\u270a...\u270a...\u270a\u270a<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHOCK><FP_RIGHT>No,
the time for that is later.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Pardon me.
It's nothing at all.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>But now, <MYNAME>, let me
see you home.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHOCK><FP_RIGHT>I want to spend that extra
time with you as we go.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Mean nothing? You may be
right.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You are a more practical-
minded girl than I expected.<PAGE>Not that there's anything
wrong with that.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>But don't you think that
you miss out on some of
life that way?<PAGE>Music, feelings...
Not everything that matters
is visible to the eye.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Isn't it okay to sometimes
have a daydream, or believe
in a legend?<PAGE>For myself, I believe so.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>In any case, we should be
getting back.
Goodbye, <MYNAME>.
