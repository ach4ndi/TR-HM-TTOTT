----------------------------|----------------------------------
Please enter a name for your

----------------------------|----------------------------------
Please enter a name for your

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You'd like to name your

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Great! They're both
fantastic names!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Well then, I'll let Jessica
explain how to take care of
your animals to you.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>So, <MYNAME>...<PAGE>I'm going to explain how
to take care of your new
animals. Are you ready?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>This is the <RED>barn</COLOR>.<PAGE>It's where you keep your
cows and sheep.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Well? What do you think?
Isn't it magnificent?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I'll let you explain all
about how to raise these
animals, then!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>First, let me explain how
to put your cow out to
graze...<PAGE>If you stand next to your
cow and push it, it'll move
in the direction you push.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Here's where you take them
when you want them to
graze...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>...This area right here.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>You don't have to give them
feed on sunny days, because
they'll eat the grass here.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Make sure you bring them in
for the night, though.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>One thing you have to watch
out for when letting your
animals out is the weather.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_SAD>Don't let them out when the
weather's bad.<PAGE>If you let your animals out
when it's raining, they'll
get stressed.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>The weather can be nice in
the morning, but it can
still rain in the afternoon.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>When the weather's too bad
to let your animals out,
feed them <RED>fodder</COLOR>.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Take the fodder...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>...And throw it in the feed
box.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Then, your animals will come
and eat it!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, and if you put your
fodder in <RED>storage</COLOR>...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>...You can take it out of
that dispenser there!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I sell fodder at my store,
so stop by and buy some!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>But first, I'll give you
some as a housewarming
gift!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>One bag of fodder will last
5 meals, so you can hold 10
meals worth in the feed box.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Now, let me tell you how to
keep your animals healthy.<PAGE>First, make sure to feed
your animals once a day.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>And don't forget to talk
to them, either!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>If you forget to feed them,
or don't talk to them,
they'll get stressed.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_SAD>If they become too stressed,
they'll get sick.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>If one of your animals gets
sick, be sure to give them
<RED>Animal Medicine</COLOR>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_SAD>If you don't help them,
they'll get sicker and
sicker, and eventually die.<PAGE>You don't want that, so make
sure your animals have a
long and happy life.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>But keep this in mind...<PAGE>No matter how well you take
care of your animals, they
can't live forever...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You can get milk from
healthy, adult cows.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>The stronger your bond, the
better the milk will be!<PAGE>That's why you need to make
sure to take care of your
animals every day!<PAGE>Now, I have a few things to
give you. Let me do that
before I forget!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>This is a <RED>milker</COLOR>!<PAGE>Use this to milk your cow.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>This is a <RED>brush</COLOR>! Use this to
brush your animals and keep
them clean.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Make sure to brush them
every day, because they can
get sick if they're dirty.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Also, let me explain
something important to
you...<PAGE>On the upper left of
the top screen is a
blue gauge.<PAGE>That gauge tells you how
much <RED>Stamina</COLOR> you have
left.<PAGE>When you use a tool, <RED>it
reduces your Stamina</COLOR>. You'll
<RED>pass out</COLOR> if it gets empty.<PAGE>If you pass out, you <RED>won't
be able to work anymore
that day</COLOR>, so be careful.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>However, you can recover
some Stamina by eating
something.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>This is the chicken coop.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>The chicken coop is quite
magnificent as well, don't
you think?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Here's the basics of how to
care for your chickens.<PAGE>Put your chickens outside on
sunny days, just like you do
with your cows.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>If you do that, they'll find
food on the ground to eat
automatically!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Just pick up your chickens
and put them in the fenced
area outside.<PAGE>Here's the area you want to
take them...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>This area here!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Just like cows, make sure
you bring your chickens back
into the coop at night.<PAGE>Remember, though! Don't let
them out when the weather's
bad!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>When the weather's too bad
to let your chickens out,
give them <RED>chicken feed</COLOR>.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT><RED>This area</COLOR> is where the
chicken feed should be
spread.<PAGE>Just like with fodder, if
you put your chicken feed
in <RED>storage</COLOR>...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Just like with the fodder
if you put the chicken feed
into <RED>storage</COLOR>...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>...You can take it out of
that dispenser there!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Let me give you some chicken
feed to start with!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>One bag of chicken feed will
last 5 meals.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>That means you can hold
10 meals worth in each
feeding area.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>In addition, healthy
chickens will lay
<RED>eggs</COLOR>!<PAGE>The stronger your bond, the
better their eggs will be!<PAGE>That's why you need to make
sure to take care of your
animals every day!<PAGE>And that's the basics
of taking care of
chickens!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>You should also give your
animals <RED>treats</COLOR> to become
more friendly with them!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Here's some <RED>treats</COLOR>. Give
some to your animals
later.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You can only give an animal
<RED>one treat a day</COLOR>.<PAGE>Animals like different kinds
of treats, so feel free to
experiment!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>If you give them treats they
like, they'll give you more
milk and eggs than usual!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And that's basically all
you need to know about
caring for animals!<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>That was quite detailed!
Thank you, Jessica!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Don't mention it!

press the <RED>A Button</COLOR> and the
Shipping Bin screen will<PAGE>appear on the bottom screen.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Just put the milk or other
items you want to ship in
