Thanks for this!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY>The cows have been really
restless lately...<PAGE>A boar or some other animal
might be bothering them. I
need to check it out.<PAGE>You should be on guard
at <MYFARMNAME> Farm, too.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Good work!
Thanks for this!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY>Huh?
You think I spoil Cheryl?
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SAD>Hmm...maybe you're right.
My mom is always chiding me
not to spoil her too much.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY>I'll try to watch out
for that...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks!
Good work!
This is perfect!<PAGE>Now I can make that
dessert Cheryl wanted.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL>Huh?
You think I spoil her?
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SAD>Hmm...maybe you're right.
My mom is always chiding me
not to spoil her so much.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL>But you know...<PAGE>When she looks at me
with those huge eyes
and says,<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY>"I don't want others,
I want the ones you make!"<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SAD>There's no way I can
refuse her...<PAGE>I guess I'm kind of a
sucker that way.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY>Well, what can I do?
<PAGE>Making my sister happy and
making my animals happy.
That's what I live for!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Good work!
Thanks for this!<PAGE>So I said this would be a
collaboration, but I'm not
too confident, to be honest.<PAGE>That's why I need to try
a few different things out!

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thank you very much.

Thanks for this!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SHY>Dr. Ayame is...a
really amazing doctor...
<PAGE>But she does thrust these
sudden jobs on me like
this sometimes...<PAGE>I wish she wouldn't.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL>But I am still
an apprentice, after all.<PAGE>Maybe she does it
for a good reason...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL>...\u270b<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_ANGRY>Oh! Maybe it's so...
I won't panic when something

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You did such a good job!
Thanks for this!
<PAGE>Sorry for asking for
such a strange favor...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SAD>To tell you the truth...
I'm a little worried by
how young I look it.<PAGE>A lot of people think I'm
a teenager when they first
meet me.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SHY>I want to become a strong,
manly doctor patients feel
they can rely on...<PAGE>Like...that's it!
I want to be big and
strong like Kana!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_ANGRY>And to get like that,
I have to change the
way that I eat!<PAGE>If I do that, I know I'll
get big and buff like Kana!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SHOCK>Ha ha.
Wish me luck!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>You did such a good job!
Thanks for this!
<PAGE>Now Dr. Ayame won't make
me...
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_ANGRY>...\u270b<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY>Oh!
Um, n-never mind.
Don't listen to me!

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>You did such a good job!
Thanks for this!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL>Huh?
You look puzzled...
<PAGE>These natural items have
some wonderful properties.
<PAGE>You know, for example...
Lavender is relaxing...
<PAGE>And tomatoes are good for
warding off all sorts
of illnesses.<PAGE>Like they say, a tomato a
day keeps the doctor away...
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY>There are likely many more
plants with healing
properties yet undiscovered.<PAGE>I've been studying
traditional folk remedies
to try and find out...<PAGE>Heh heh.
Bet you didn't expect
that, huh?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thank you very much.

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks.
You did a great job.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL>Howard said not to
worry about it, but
I couldn't help it.<PAGE>I guess this is just to
make myself feel better.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>That's great.
Thanks so much.<PAGE>...\u270bWhat's that look for?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY>Wh-What else could I do?
It's still a kitten...
No mother cat around...<PAGE>It came up and rubbed
against me...<PAGE>It...
It was so cute...<PAGE>And I couldn't just...
ignore it...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD>And I can't keep it
at the caf...<PAGE>So I at least wanted
to give it something
to eat...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL>Um. Could you not stare,
please?\u270a\u270a
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY>I-It's embarrassing...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks.
That's perfect.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD>Pretty pitiful, huh?<PAGE>I didn't realize I was
out of flowers...<PAGE>I guess I need to pay
more attention to things.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Great job.
I've got it now.<PAGE>See, I've got this
friend named Lloyd...
<PAGE>And he's looking for
something to sell at
the bazaar...<PAGE>I don't know much

flowers, so...<PAGE>I was in a bit of

my time to taking
care of Hayate...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_SHY>I don't want Hayate
or the other horses
to get sick...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL>So it's important to keep up
maintenance on the barn.
How's yours looking?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks!
That's perfect!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_HAPPY>The horses get bored of
fodder after a while<PAGE>I wanted to give them
something else to eat...<PAGE>I figured they'd be
happy if I gave them
some fruits and vegetables.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL>Not too much, of course.
Just occasionally for
treats.<PAGE>Unlike humans, horses eat
fruits and vegetables for
the water in them.<PAGE>So it's not good for
them to have too many.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_SHY>What's that?
You look impressed.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL>Spoiling someone isn't
always the best way to
give them love...<PAGE>Diet is really
important for animals.<PAGE>If you don't think about
what you're giving them,
you can make them sick.<PAGE>So you should be careful!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks!
This is perfect!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_HAPPY>Heh heh.
I've been waiting for this!<PAGE>You know, moon gazing
is pretty fun!<PAGE>The moon looks different
during each season, and
the full moon is so nice!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_SHY>What's with that face?<PAGE>I can enjoy a little
culture every once in

an incredible guy...<PAGE>His job takes him back and

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_LANEY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks so much!
This is just what I wanted!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_LANEY><FACE_SHY>My dad's cooking is always
so fancy...
<PAGE>Like, he always writes
LOVE in ketchup on his
omelets...<PAGE>And that's the least
of it! Sometimes he
draws a self-portrait!<PAGE>A really realistic one!
<PAGE>And it kind of creeps me
out to eat my dad's face
on my food, you know?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_LANEY><FACE_SAD>And you should see the
other crazy things he
does with our food...<PAGE>I know he has fun with it,
but really, now...<PAGE>I can't imagine what

flowers for...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_LANEY><FACE_NORMAL>Did you know some flowers
are edible?<PAGE>You can put them in salad...
or in soups...
or decorate cakes with them.<PAGE>You can also coat them in
sugar and eat them that way.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_LANEY><FACE_HAPPY>Hee hee.
Bet you never thought you
could eat flowers, huh?<PAGE>I was surprised at first
too, but it's a neat idea,
so I want to give it a try!

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_LANEY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks!
This is perfect!<PAGE>I want to make everyone

<PAGE>Now listen up...
It's all about...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_ANGRY>\u20d0Your\u270a second stomach!<PAGE>Desserts go to a special
place in your body, so
they're not bad for you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_HAPPY>It's totally true! Honest!
Besides, I'd just go plum
crazy without desserts.<PAGE>And there's no sense in
being healthy if you aren't
happy!

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Hmm...
I suppose it's hard to
tell by just looking...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_SHY>It looks like I'll have
to examine this under a
microscope...<PAGE>Or maybe...
I should ask Mako to crush
it up for me...<PAGE>No, but then the seeds
would get crushed too.
There's no point in that.<PAGE>What I really want to do
is examine the fossil

be a nice dessert cheese...
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY>I don't know if this will
work or not, but I'm going

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thank you, <MYNAME>!
This is just what I need!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL>Ash has been working
so hard lately.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY>Farm work isn't easy, but
he never complains.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_SAD>But all that work really
does a number on his
clothes.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_NORMAL>I've got to mend them for
him while there's still more
cloth than holes.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_JESSICA><FACE_HAPPY>Thank you so much for
the wool!

Not bad...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_ANGRY>But my brother could

Pretty good, actually.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_HAPPY>Hee hee. It smells pretty!
Now I smell all grown up!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_ANGRY>Don't tell my brother!
I'm going to surprise him!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_HAPPY>I bet he'll think it
smells pretty too!

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Okay, not bad!
Pretty good, even!<PAGE>This will help me scare
away any girls who get
near...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_ANGRY>\u20d0...my brother!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_SAD>If Ash gets a girlfriend,
then he'll spend all his
time with her.<PAGE>Then he won't have any time
to play with me!
<PAGE>\u20d0I won't let that happen!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_HAPPY>Grown up ladies hate
bugs, right?<PAGE>I'm going to use these to
scare them!<PAGE>I feel bad for the bugs,
but it's the only way to
protect my big brother!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_ANGRY>You fulfilled my request,
so you're my partner in
crime, okay, <MYNAME>?<PAGE>This will be our secret!
Promise?
<PAGE>If you tell anyone...
Then...\u270b
\u20d0I won't talk to you again!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thank you very much.
I was waiting for this.

<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_HAPPY>Oh wow, this looks so

Thank you!<PAGE>Now I'll have something to

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thank you so much!
This looks great!<PAGE>I have a wreath hanging

I'm going to make a really
cute new wreath!<RED>❤</COLOR>
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks! This is great!
<PAGE>This job came up really

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks for this!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_HAPPY>Oh good!<RED>❤</COLOR>
Now I can be a good
hostess...<PAGE>Thank you so much!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_NORMAL>You see... I've got
some guests coming.
Some people Howard knows.<PAGE>Apparently they want to be
my apprentice...
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_SAD>The things is...
I don't really want or
need an apprentice...<PAGE>But Howard said that it
wouldn't hurt to meet them.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_NORMAL>He even brought me pictures
of them!
<PAGE>He was so insistent that I
had to at least meet them.
I couldn't turn him down.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_SAD>I'm just going to turn
them down, so maybe I
shouldn't meet them at all.<PAGE>I feel bad for them...
Hmm...
<PAGE>But then again...
\u270aWhat if I was Sheng?
What would I do then?\u270b<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_HAPPY>Oh, sorry!
Just thinking out loud!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_EILEEN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thank you very much.
I was waiting for this.

\u270b<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_HAPPY>Just kidding!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks, <MYNAME>.
This is just what I need!<PAGE>\u20d0But listen to this!
We have a leak!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_SAD>I checked it out, and it
turns out some rats chewed
a hole! Isn't that horrible?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL>Well, I'll just have to
patch it up.<PAGE>And I want to fix up some
other things while I'm at
it.<PAGE>It's not anything I
want to bother Eileen
with, after all...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_HAPPY>And I am the man of the
house! I can handle basic
repairs!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Ooh!\u270aThis is great!
\u20d1Very nice!<RED>❤</COLOR>
I love how fluffy it is!<RED>❤</COLOR><PAGE>Great work as always,

<PAGE>I know any clothes I make

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Great work as always,
<MYNAME>!
<PAGE>Hmm?
You want to hear what I'm
going to make with it?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_HAPPY>Heh heh.</COLOR>
I can't tell even you that,
<MYNAME>!<PAGE>It's a professional secret!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL>Actually, I've never
made it before.
<PAGE>So I don't know exactly how
the dish will turn out.<PAGE>A friend of mine in the
city told me the recipe...<PAGE>But it was mostly
improvised, and there was a
lot he couldn't remember.<PAGE>So it's going to be quite
an exciting experiment!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_HAPPY>Heh heh.
Wish me luck!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thank you very much.
I was waiting for this.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Oh!
I've been waiting for this!
This is a big help!<PAGE>Georgia and I had a fight...\u270b
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_SAD>And I would have gone
without dinner...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thanks a lot.
This is a real help.<PAGE>I'm going to send this to a
family in a village we lived
in out west.<PAGE>That's where Georgia picked
up her accent.<PAGE>She was so embarrassed of
that accent when we first
got here...<PAGE>She barely ever left the
house.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY>Her friendship with 
Laney really helped her
find her place here.<PAGE>Anyway, I wanted to let
those old friends know we're
doing fine.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><MYNAME>,
I hope you and Georgia
remain good friends!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks! This is just
what I need for the horses.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL>Hmm?
How does tea build strength?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY>Tea contains caffeine, and
catechins, and various 
vitamins...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL>In the old days, before
they sent horses to race...<PAGE>they would build their
strength and speed by
feeding them tea leaves...<PAGE>It made a big difference!
<PAGE>They don't do it anymore,
because it's seen as
cheating...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY>But a little bit of tea
leaves can do horses a world
of good.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL>Just a little, though. It's
no good to give them too
much.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY>Heh! See? You learn
something new every day.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks! This is
just what I needed...<PAGE>Hmm? Am I just going to
give this to the horses
as treats?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL>Heh heh.
Good question!<PAGE>This has to be dried.
<PAGE>You know how we have
dried fruit and
dried vegetables?<PAGE>When you dry fruits and
vegetables, it concentrates
the vitamins.<PAGE>They get sweeter too, so
I thought they'd be good
treats!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY>Heh heh.
Pretty good idea, huh?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Thank you very much.

It's just a little

you to worry about me.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_SAD>It's not that I

I didn't say anything!
Never mind!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RAHI><FACE_ANGRY>I-I said I was going to

Forget that!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RAHI><FACE_ANGRY>I-I'm going to put these

Um...uh...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RAHI><FACE_ANGRY>There's too many to put in

onion.
You wouldn't guess, right?<PAGE>The juice of this

the time of day...
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_DIRK><FACE_NORMAL>I went to Bluebell on a
delivery...<PAGE>And I saw Cam the florist
playing with a stray cat!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_DIRK><FACE_SHOCK>It was such a beautiful
cat that I was jealous!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_DIRK><FACE_NORMAL>I wanted to play
with her too...
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_DIRK><FACE_SAD>But the second she saw
me, she ran away with her
fur standing on end!<PAGE>She just zoomed away!
Isn't that mean?<PAGE>And Cam was mad at me
for scaring her!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_DIRK><FACE_ANGRY>But I didn't do anything!
That cat just has a
hard heart!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_DIRK><FACE_SHOCK>Man...
That's just part of
her charm I guess!<RED>❤</COLOR>
