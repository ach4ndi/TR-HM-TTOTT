<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Let me introduce you to
my beloved horse,
Hayate!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I should mention that Hayate
and I are pretty close.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>But I'll bet you already
figured that out.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Hayate and I actually grew
up together.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>She gave me a lot of trouble
as a kid! She wouldn't let
anyone ride her.<PAGE>But of course, I was too
stubborn to quit trying.<PAGE>I fed her by hand every day
until she trusted me enough
to let me ride her.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Since then, her and I have
never missed a chance to
ride.<PAGE>But now that she's getting
older, she gets leg pains
sometimes.<PAGE>So I don't push her too
hard these days.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> She's like family...
 Let's race!

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Yeah, exactly! I've known
her as long as I've known
anyone.<PAGE>She's a part of my family.
I can't imagine life without
her.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Isn't that right,
Hayate?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Haha, cut it out!
That tickles!!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Hey, <MYNAME>, I'm glad
I got to introduce you to
Hayate today.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Seems like Hayate likes you
too.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I hope you'll stop by
sometime to see Hayate
again.<PAGE>Thanks for coming today,
<MYNAME>.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>C'mon, <MYNAME>,
did you even listen to me?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_KANA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>Even as a joke,
saying stuff like that
isn't cool.<PAGE>I know I asked you to come
over, but I'd like you to
leave now.
