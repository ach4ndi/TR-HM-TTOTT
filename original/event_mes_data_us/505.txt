<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Dum-Da-Da-DAA!
Good morning,
<MYNAME>!<PAGE>I've got a favor to ask you!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>That's why I'm going to take
you to my spring at the
top of the mountain!<PAGE>\u20d0Here we go!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Dum-Da-Da-DAA! Welcome to my
spring!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Now, I know this is sudden,
but there's something I want
to ask you!<PAGE><MYNAME>, have you ever
wanted to share the crops
you grow with other people?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>That's what I thought!
I knew I could count
on you!<PAGE>Come, follow me into the
spring!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>So, what do you think?
I bet you weren't expecting
something like this!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>This is the <RED>Multiplayer
Field</COLOR>!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>The Multiplayer Field is a
special field you can use
in Multiplayer Mode!<PAGE>What makes it special? Well,
<RED>you can't harvest the crops</COLOR>
you grow here.<PAGE>But you can <RED>invite friends</COLOR>
here, and <RED>they can harvest
the crops that you've grown</COLOR>!<PAGE>It's a wonderful chance to
share your crops with other
people!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Anyway, I thought I'd give
you the Multiplayer Field
as a present!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Thanks!
 I don't want it!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Tee-hee! I'm glad you like
it!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Anyway, you grow crops on
this field a little
differently than usual...<PAGE>It's pretty different from a
normal field. Do you want me
to explain it to you?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I can answer any questions
you have!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
dummy
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_ABC> What can I do here?
 How do I grow crops here?
 Next.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>The process of growing crops
on the Multiplayer Field
is different than normal.<PAGE>Usually you need to cut
down the grass with a sickle
before you plant crops.<PAGE>But you don't need to cut
any grass here, as you can
see.<PAGE>Also, there's no set seasons
in the Multiplayer Field.<PAGE>So, before you sow your
seeds, you have to use a
<RED>Sun</COLOR> to chose the season.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>That's a <RED>Sun</COLOR> right there!<PAGE>If you want to change the
season, <RED>put the Sun from
that season there</COLOR>!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Is there anything else you
want to ask me about?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Well then, let me explain
what you can do with
Multiplayer Mode.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Like I said, you can invite
friends over to harvest
crops you've grown...<PAGE>...Or you can visit a
friend's field to take home
some of their crops.<PAGE>The first thing you'll want
to do is invite a friend to
your farm.<PAGE>Next, choose how much the
<RED>entrance fee</COLOR> is to enter
your farm.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>Make sure your fee's not too
high, though, or no one will
want to come to your farm...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, and if you want to leave
during Multiplayer Mode...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Well, good luck, then!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh! I almost forgot! It's
really important!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Remember to give me lots of
offerings when you stop by
my spring!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Just throw them right in the
water! I'll get them!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>By the way, I really like
sweet, red berries! Well,
I'll be waiting!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>...Right here! Don't forget,
now!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>...Just exit right through
there!<PAGE>However, the connection
won't end until <RED>all players
have exited</COLOR>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Everyone harvests at a
different pace, so be nice
and wait for everyone!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I'll give you your collected
entrance fees after you exit
Multiplayer Mode.<PAGE>So select <RED>Continue</COLOR> from the
Main Menu and come back
here to collect it!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT><RED>You can't invite anyone else</COLOR>
to Multiplayer Mode until
you collect the fees.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Oh, and if you use
Multiplayer Mode a lot,
I'll give you a reward!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>By the way, are you watering
your crops every day,
<MYNAME>?<PAGE>Normal crops will wilt if
you don't water them every
day...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>...But the crops here won't
wilt, even if you don't
water them!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>However, even though they
won't wilt, they won't grow
unless you water them!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>But if you're busy, that
means that you don't need to
water your crops here!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You're free to raise the
crops here at your own
pace!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>In Multiplayer Mode, you can
invite friends over to
harvest crops you've grown!<PAGE>And you can also go to their
Multiplayer Fields to
harvest crops they've grown!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Tee-hee! Doesn't that sound
fun?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, before I explain more,
let me tell you how to go to
Multiplayer Mode...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>First, select <RED>Multiplayer</COLOR>
from the <RED>Main Menu</COLOR>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>There are two ways to play
Multiplayer Mode.<PAGE>To play with <RED>nearby
friends</COLOR>, select <RED>Local
Wireless</COLOR>.<PAGE>To play with <RED>far
away friends</COLOR>, select
<RED>Nintendo WFC</COLOR>.<PAGE>You'll need a <RED>wireless
internet connection</COLOR> and<PAGE>at least one friend's
<RED>friend code</COLOR> to play over
<RED>Nintendo WFC</COLOR>, though.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>First, change the Sun to the
season you'd like.<PAGE>After you've done that, just
till the field, sow the
seeds, and water them!<PAGE>Oh, only you can't sow
<RED>wheat</COLOR>, <RED>buckwheat</COLOR>, <RED>soybeans</COLOR>,
or use <RED>fertilizer</COLOR>!<PAGE>Keep that in mind!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Ah, I need to show you
where you can get water!
You can get it...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>...\u270a\u270a...\u270a\u270a...\u270a\u270a<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Tee-hee! I'm glad you like
it!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Anyway, you grow crops on
this field a little
differently than usual...<PAGE>It's pretty different from a
normal field. Do you want me
to explain it to you?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I can answer any questions
you have!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_ABC> Explain friend codes.
 I'm done.
 Back.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You need a <RED>friend code</COLOR> to
connect to Nintendo WFC.<PAGE>A friend code is a number
used to distinguish between
users. Everyone has one.<PAGE>You can enter a friend's
friend code directly in your
friend roster.<PAGE>Or, when you connect to
people over local wireless,<PAGE>their friend codes will
automatically be entered
in your friend roster.<PAGE>But if you already have
30 friends on your
friend roster,<PAGE>your new friend will not
be registered on your
friend roster automatically.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And that's everything! Now
let me take you back to your
house, <MYNAME>!<PAGE>I'll take you back home this
time...<PAGE>...But next time, you'll
have to get home on your
own!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HGODDES><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Well, I hope I see you at
the Multiplayer Field!
Toodles!
