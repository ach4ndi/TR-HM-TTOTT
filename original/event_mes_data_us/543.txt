<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Sorry to drop in so early in
the morning. How are your
crops growing?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I'm going to teach you about
<RED>irrigation trenches</COLOR> today.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Do you know about trenches?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Here's what an irrigation
trench looks like!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>When you grow crops in a
trench, you can water and
fertilize them all at once.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Handy, right?
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Trenches are very easy to
make.<PAGE>While you're tilling with
the hoe, keep the <RED>+Control
Pad</COLOR> pressed in a direction!<PAGE>Then press the <RED>A Button</COLOR>
over each new square you
step on.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Each new square you till
will be added to the trench.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>But you do have to watch out
for one thing...<PAGE>Trenches must be in one
unbroken line...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You can't branch trenches
or connect them up to each
other, in other words.<PAGE>If you make a mistake
digging a trench,<PAGE>you can only fix it by
hammering the ground flat
and trying again.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>So to make a trench like
this, you'd till in a line
from one arrow to the other.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>But...\u270aif you leave a tilled
square untended for a
week...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>The trench will disappear at
that spot!<PAGE>If that breaks a long trench
in the middle, too bad!
It can't be fixed.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>That's why you need to be
careful.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And that's basically what
you need to know about
irrigation trenches.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Would you like me to explain
it to you one more time?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Explain it again, please!
 No thanks, I got it!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>OK, I'll explain it again.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>An irrigation trench is a
continuous line of tilled
squares.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Let me show you a trench and
explain it to you.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Great! Happy farming!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> No, please teach me.
 Yes, I already know.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>All right, I'll explain!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>An irrigation trench is a
continuous line of tilled
squares.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>It's easiest to just show
you an example.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Oh, you do?
You're on the ball, aren't
you?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Well, happy farming!
