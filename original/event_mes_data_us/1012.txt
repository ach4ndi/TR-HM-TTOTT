<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Oh, these? These are my
medical books.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I haven't yet learned the
material in all of them.<PAGE>I've still got a long way to
go in my studies!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Yes, it can be daunting!<PAGE>At first, I could barely
understand anything written
in these books.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Now I can read them thanks
to my studies at the medical
school in the city...<PAGE>But even as a child I would
imitate my father by opening
his medical books...<PAGE>I couldn't read them, but
I would scribble in them!
That made Father angry.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>As a matter of fact, most of
the books on this shelf
belonged to my father.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>My father was a doctor in
the city.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Father became a doctor in
order to help my mother,
who was sickly from youth.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Wasn't that romantic of him?

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Ever since I was a child,
I've respected what my
father did...<PAGE>I made it my goal in life to
become as fine a doctor
as he was.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>But it appears that I will
never be the doctor that
he was.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>I've been making too many
errors in my work lately...<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>I'll never amount to
anything at this rate...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Everyone makes mistakes.
 Hard work will pay off.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>Yes, that is true. It
is too true...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>A patient's life is in
their doctor's hands.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_ANGRY><FP_LEFT>A mistake can be the
difference between
life and death.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>So I can't just shrug off
mistakes.<PAGE>And if I become a doctor who
makes more mistakes than
most...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Oh, forgive me!
This is not what I meant
to discuss with you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>I shouldn't keep you too
late. I'm sure you have
things to do.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Yes. Maybe you have a
point...<PAGE>"Nothing worth having was
ever gotten easily," Father
always said.<PAGE>He also said as a doctor's
apprentice, he made mistakes
and learned much from them.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>If I keep trying, I can
overcome these mistakes
I've been making.<PAGE>I must not give up. I must
not be dismayed. There is no
time to waste on doubts!<PAGE>I can only overcome my
mistakes through hard work
and perseverance.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT><MYNAME>, you always know what
to say to help me.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_SHOCK><FP_LEFT>I hope that there will be an
opportunity for me to return
the favor sometime.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HIRO><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>It would be my greatest
pleasure to be able to
help you, <MYNAME>.
