when I was young...<PAGE>And I've been afraid that if
I love anyone else, I'll
lose them, too.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ALISA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>...<PAGE>But that was foolish. You

from loving others and
living my life.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ALISA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>If you can forgive me for
