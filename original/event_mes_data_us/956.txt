<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You're a farmer, aren't you,
<MYNAME>?
<PAGE>Farming seems like a mighty
hard job.<PAGE>You've got to look after
all those crops as well as
your animals.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> It's a lot of work.
 It's a breeze!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>I'll bet!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And yet I never hear a peep
of complaint out of you.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>You're pretty amazing,
<MYNAME>!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Goodness knows I have my
hands full just looking
after the animals.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>They are sweet things,
though, so I don't mind!

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>You like horses, don't you?

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Next time I'll have to show
you my favorite horse!
She's a real sweet thing!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>That's a promise!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I do have a mighty fine
time talking with you,
<MYNAME>.<PAGE>We should talk again
soon! I'll see you later!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>Is that so?<PAGE>Well, you can't be taking
your work seriously if you
think that.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Why, I myself only take
care of our animals...
<PAGE>But it's a lot of work
keeping them all happy
and healthy.<PAGE>And plants have got to need
just as much love and
attention.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>So if you were really doing
your job, I don't think
you'd say it was a breeze.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GEORGIA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Sorry for jumping all over
you like that. Maybe it's
none of my business.<PAGE>But I had to speak my mind.
<PAGE>Anyway, it's getting late,
so I do believe I'll head
home. Bye, <MYNAME>.
