<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>How's work on the farm?
Everything going fine?

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Hey, that's great!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>...Huh?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, you've got a tear in
your shirt here. Hold still
for a second...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>All done!
How's that?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Oh, it was no problem!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Do I always walk around
with my sewing kit?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Yes, I do!
Well, not ALWAYS,
but most of the time!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>My sewing kit and my
necklace are heirlooms from
my grandmother.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>My grandmother was really
handy around the house.<PAGE>Sewing, cooking, you name
it! My grandmother taught me
everything I know!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>I was so sad when
she passed away.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> You really loved her...
 That must've been tough.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Yes. Very, very much.<PAGE>But I still had my
grandfather, so I wasn't
alone.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Even though it was really
hard on my grandfather to
lose my grandmother...<PAGE>When I'd cry, he'd smile and
say that grandma would want
us to keep living happily.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>If it wasn't for my grandpa,
I don't know how I would
have gotten through that.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I hope there's something I
can do to help him as much
someday.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>Um, sorry about that.
It's not a very happy
subject to talk about.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks, <MYNAME>.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>It's getting late, so we
should be getting home.<PAGE>I really enjoyed talking to
you today. Can I invite you
out again?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Ha ha! Okay!
Until next time, then!
Bye!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Tough?
I don't know about that.<PAGE>I was just a kid
It was sad, but I wouldn't
say it was tough, exactly.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>It was definitely tough for
my grandfather, though.<PAGE>After my grandmother passed
away, he had no time to be
sad while taking care of me.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>So I want to be able to
take care of him.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>Um, sorry about that.
It's not a very happy
subject to talk about.
