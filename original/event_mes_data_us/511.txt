<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>This is a <RED>pot</COLOR>!<PAGE>There are a lot of recipes
that you'll need a pot to
make!<PAGE>Using this will let you cook
more recipes, dearie!<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Use it well!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Well now, do you know how to

<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>My my, I see. Then I'll
explain it to you, dearie.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>There are two ways you can
learn a recipe.<PAGE>The first is by reading a
cookbook and following
the instructions.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>If you make the dish
correctly, you'll
learn the recipe!<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>The second is by thinking up
a new recipe after you've
been <RED>inspired</COLOR>!<PAGE>If you cook a lot of dishes,
sometimes you'll think of
a new recipe!<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Even when you want to make
a lot of the same dish, you
should make them one by one!<PAGE>That way, you'll have more
opportunities to get
inspired!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_YUN><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>So, that's how you learn
recipes! Do you understand,
dearie?
