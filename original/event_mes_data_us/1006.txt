<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>It sounds like it's time to
change my strings...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I'm sorry, <MYNAME>. How
careless of me.<PAGE>A violinist should never let
his strings get to such a
poor state.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>My violin has four strings.
I use fingers or my bow to
pluck them to make sounds.<PAGE>But after they have been
used for a while, violin
strings sound bad, or snap.<PAGE>Before that happens, new
strings must be carefully
strung on the violin...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>I've been so busy recently
that I completely forgot to
restring my instrument!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, it's nothing to worry
about. I just need to change
the strings. It'll be fine.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Did you know that violins
last a very long time?<PAGE>If you change your strings
diligently, you can play the
same violin for 100 years.<PAGE>My violin was handed down to
me by my instructor.
It's an old one.<PAGE>This remarkable violin has
been played for 90 years.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> It's a hand-me-down?
 It's an heirloom!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>Maybe you should consider
your choice of words more
carefully, <MYNAME>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>I lost my parents when I was
young. My teacher took me
in.<PAGE>This is a memento of him.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>So when you call it a "hand-
-me-down," you are
mocking his memory. 
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>Excuse me, but I no longer
want to talk to you today.
Please go home.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Yes, it is.
This violin is very
important to me.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I lost my parents when I
was young. My violin teacher
was like a father to me.<PAGE>He taught me the importance
of music, and the glories of
the violin.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I was entranced by the
melodies he created with
this instrument.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I have never met anyone who
could make a violin sound
the way he could.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>This violin is a precious
memento of him.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I'm sorry, I went off on a
tangent there.<PAGE>It has been a long time
since I talked so much
about my past.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>It must be that gentle
voice of yours that makes
me talkative...

<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Today was a high note
thanks to you, <MYNAME>.<PAGE>Let me escort you home
before it gets too late.
