each one all the love and
attention it needs.

<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>So we have this new lamb
now called Snow...<PAGE>She likes to run away. If
you take your eyes off her
for a second, she's gone!<PAGE>I guess she still misses
her parents. Poor thing.<PAGE>She doesn't seem to be
getting along with the 
other animals yet.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Oh no! And there she is now.
Looks like she got out
again.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Push her back to her pen.
 Try and talk to her.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Hey, stop it!
Now she's totally stressed
out.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I can't believe it.
What did you say to Snow?
<PAGE>I've never seen anyone
reason with a lamb before.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>But the way you tried to
force her back into her
pen at first hurt to watch.<PAGE>I could tell from Snow's
cries that she was really
scared.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh well.
I'm glad she went
back to her pen.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks, <MYNAME>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Well, I want to check on
Snow, so I should be
getting home.

her own.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks, <MYNAME>.<PAGE>It looks like there are some
