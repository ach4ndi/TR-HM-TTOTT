<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Hey, do you remember that
lamb you helped me with
the other day?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Ever since you talked to
her, she hasn't tried to run
away.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Hey, do you want to come
and see her now?
<PAGE>I know Snow would
be happy to see you!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>She really likes you.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Protect Snow.
 Watch what happens.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>What was that?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>I think that cow was just
trying to make friends with
Snow.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>I know you've got a bond,
but I think you're being a
little overprotective.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Helping out all the
time isn't always right.<PAGE>It's important to let
her stand on her own four
legs sometimes.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Sorry. That was kind of
obnoxious of me.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Oh, you've been here a
while. You should probably
be getting home.<PAGE>Thanks for coming today.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_CHERYL><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>......
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>You two seem to be getting
along well.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I thought you might be the
type who rushes in to help
even when it's not needed.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>But you were wonderful.
You really know the animals.
I shouldn't have worried.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I really owe you my thanks.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>For Snow, I mean.
She's been doing so well
since she met you...<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>She's even getting along
with the other animals now.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Without your help, Snow
might still be an unhappy
little lamb.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>So I wanted to thank you.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>You always make me realize
just how far I have to go
to be a great farmer.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_ANGRY><FP_LEFT>Trying to measure up to
you is a great motivator!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>I guess that's one of the
reasons I'm always happy
to spend time with you.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>Oh no!
I didn't realize how late
it had gotten.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Time always flies when I'm
with you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_ASH><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Sorry to keep you so long.
Let me walk you home.
