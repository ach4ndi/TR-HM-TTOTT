<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Is your work on the farm
going smoothly?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Today, my young friend,
I'm going to teach you
about <RED>irrigation trenches</COLOR>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Do you know about trenches?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Here we are!
An irrigation trench!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>When you grow crops in a
trench, you can water and
fertilize them all at once.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Handy, right?
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL>Trenches are very easy to
make.<PAGE>While you're tilling with
the hoe, keep the <RED>+Control
Pad</COLOR> pressed in a direction!<PAGE>Then press the <RED>A Button</COLOR>
over each new square you
step on.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Each new square you till
will be added to the trench.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>But you do have to watch out
for one thing...<PAGE>Trenches must be in one
unbroken line...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>In other words, you can't
branch trenches or connect
them up to each other.<PAGE>If you make a mistake
digging a trench, there's
only one way to fix it...<PAGE>...And that's by hammering
the ground flat and trying
again.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>So to make a trench like
this, you'd till in a line
from one <RED>arrow</COLOR> to the other.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>But...\u270aif you leave a
tilled square untended for
a week...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>...The trench will disappear
at that spot!<PAGE>If that breaks a long trench
in the middle, too bad!
It can't be fixed.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>That's why you need to be
careful.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>That's what you need to know
about irrigation trenches.<PAGE>Would you like me to explain
it one more time?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Please explain it again!
 No thanks, I got it!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Very well!
I'll explain one more time.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>An irrigation trench is a
continuous line of tilled
squares.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Let me show you a trench and
explain it to you.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>In that case, please go
ahead and grow some crops!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> No, please teach me.
 Yes, I already know.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Very well, I'll explain!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>An irrigation trench is a
continuous line of tilled
squares.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>It's easiest to just show
you an example.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Oh, you do?
I'm glad to hear it!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>In that case, please go
