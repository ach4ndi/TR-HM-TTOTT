fields here even if you
move to Konohana.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>But the barn there is a lot
smaller...<PAGE>So if you have a lot of
animals, you can't take
them all with you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I'll ask a friend of mine
to take care of them for
you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>That way, you won't have to
worry about them getting
sick.<PAGE>But we can't give them back
to you until you move back
to Bluebell.

get everything ready to

any loose ends the day
before.
