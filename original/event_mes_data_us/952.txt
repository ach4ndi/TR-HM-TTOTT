<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I love it here down by the
river.<PAGE>The sound of water, the
fresh scent of greenery...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Whenever I need to calm
down or I'm feeling blue,
this is where I come.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Oh, you can't imagine me
losing my calm, huh...?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Well, of course I do.<PAGE>A lot of people think I'm so
even-tempered, but nobody
is calm all the time.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>A lot of times I get really
nervous that I'll let people
down.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>Especially when they need
something difficult from me.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>And sometimes I panic when
I'm in too much of a rush to
get everything done.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And would you believe, as
a kid I was never calm!
I was a little wildcat!<PAGE>The river certainly wasn't a
place for me to be calm in
those days!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>It was a place to play and
throw rocks and be wild!
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>When I was trying to catch
fish, I'd dive right in
after them!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Ha ha!
Is it that surprising?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> You're not who I thought.
 A new side to you. Neat!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Really? Sorry about that.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>But this responsible person
you think of me as...<PAGE>Isn't that just an image you
came up with on your own?<PAGE>It's a drag when somebody
forces their image on you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>...Wow, I probably said
too much there.<PAGE>I guess I'm going to call it
a day. Bye!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SHOCK><FP_RIGHT>Y-You really think so? I'm
glad to hear you say that.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SHOCK><FP_RIGHT>Oh, I know...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>That's right!
<MYNAME>, why don't you tell
me about yourself!<PAGE>I'd love to know more about
you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_SHOCK><FP_RIGHT>It's unfair that you know
all about me and I don't
know anything about you.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Ha ha!
Why don't you come with me
to Yun's Tea House?<PAGE>You can tell me all about
yourself while we eat.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Let's go, <MYNAME>!
