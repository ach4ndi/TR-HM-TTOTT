<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, what could be wrong?
I just don't know...

<FACE_POS_LEFT><HIDE_NAME><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT><HIDE_FACE>What's up, Howard?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Sorry. I'm a little
distracted right now.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Distracted? Why?<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I'm just so worried...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>That's not like you.
What is it?
You can tell me anything.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Oh, Grady.
You're so kind.
I suppose if you insist...<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>It's my daughter, Laney.
She's been so cold to me
lately.<PAGE>I asked her if she had a
boyfriend yesterday.<PAGE>She said it was weird for
me to ask about that, and
it's none of my business.<PAGE>And that's all I could get
out of her!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>So Laney's acting that way
too?<PAGE>You know, my daughter
Georgia is the same way.<PAGE>Girls are so difficult
at that age...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Ah. Hello, everyone.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Welcome, Rutger.
<PAGE>I'm glad you're here,
actually.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I've got a question for you.
Do you mind?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Not at all. What is it?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>It's about my daughter.
She won't talk to me about
her personal life anymore.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Oh is that all?
That's not unusual
for girls her age.<PAGE>I know that you're worried,
but you mustn't push it.<PAGE>She'll come around in her
own time, Howard.
<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I know, but still...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>I'll have an order of
<VAR_0>.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>It's tough when you realize
your children don't need
you as much anymore.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Yes. It's hard to let go.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Of course. But you have to
start treating them as
adults sometime.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Laney needs to see if she
can make it without her
father's advice.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Yes. It's all part of
growing up.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mr. Rutger.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>No problem.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>You've got to trust that
your daughter will come to
you if she really needs you.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RUTGER><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Well then, I'll be going.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I'm sure Laney will talk to
you if you give her time.<PAGE>Just wait and see.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_HOWARD><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>You're right. I'll do that.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_GRADY><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>See you later.
