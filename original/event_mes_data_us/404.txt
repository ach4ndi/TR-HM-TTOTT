<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Today you're going to learn
how the town hall works.
Understand, Rahi?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RAHI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Yes, Mom.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Good.
As you know...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Here we check in guests,
help people move, and answer
questions about the village.<PAGE>The mayor's number one job
is to respond to inquiries
and look after the village.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RAHI><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>As long as the mayor is
around, the village is safe.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>That's right.
Now, the guest rooms are
this way.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Make sure you show the
guests to the correct room.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RAHI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>There are only two rooms,
so it can't be that hard.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Well, that's true!<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Now for the library!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>We used to loan out books,
but...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_SAD><FP_LEFT>Fewer people live in the
village nowadays, and not
many come by every day.<PAGE>It's a shame, since we have
such a great collection of
books in our library.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_RAHI><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>A real shame...<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Hopefully there will be more
people who use it someday.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Finally, the meeting hall.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>We use it for events, so it
really needs no explanation.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Getting along with the
villagers is an important
part of the mayor's job.<PAGE>I'm always strict with you,
but you can loosen up a bit
when you talk with people.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_RAHI><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>I understand, Mom.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Look at the time!
Let's go back inside.
