<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>I was afraid of this.
It's looking unhealthy.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Remember that plant I was
studying here the other day?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>I have come to observe it
several times since, and
it hasn't been doing well.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>No help for it.
I'll have to take it home.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>There, I have the equipment
that I need.<PAGE>I can examine it and perhaps
figure out the reason it's
unhealthy.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Look at this! The roots are
diseased!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>It will be okay, though.
I'll carefully replant it,
and it will soon recover.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Hmm? What?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, you're wondering about
all these books.<PAGE>Yes, they're all my books
about plants.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Plants are fascinating!
 Plants are so soothing!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Yes, they are. Such a
variety of interesting
traits and adaptations.<PAGE>No matter how much I study
them, I never cease to be
fascinated.<PAGE>And I still read about new
plants being discovered all
over the world.<PAGE>If I search hard enough, I'm
sure I can find a new
species of plant.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Then I could be published in
a major journal!<PAGE>But who should I name the
plant after? I shouldn't
name it after myself...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, there I go getting all
carried away.
Sorry about that.<PAGE>But I'm glad to hear that
you like plants too,
<MYNAME>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Perhaps we could...if it's
all right with you...go look
at plants again sometime.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>It's true, a lot of people
find plants soothing.<PAGE>But did you know that some
plants actually sustain
themselves by eating bugs?<PAGE>And some plants have poison.
You know, <MYNAME>, you have
to be careful around plants.<PAGE>Of course, most around
here are perfectly safe.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_REINA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Well, I have things to do.
I'll see you some other
time, <MYNAME>.
