<FACE_POS_LEFT><HIDE_NAME><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT><HIDE_FACE>Good morning, <MYNAME>.
Thought I'd drop by for a
visit.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Sorry to barge in on you so
early.<PAGE>I came to tell you some
things that will be handy
to know for your life here.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Come with me to the town
square.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>今日は、<MYNAME>に
おつかいについて
話しておこうと思ってな。<PAGE>口で説明するより
実際に見た方が
早いだろう。<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL>ついて来てくれ。
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>This is the <RED>message board</COLOR>.<PAGE>Villagers who need something
done will post their
<RED>requests</COLOR> here.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>To read the requests, just
stand in front of the board
and press the <RED>A Button</COLOR>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I hope you'll take on some
requests when you have the
opportunity.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>OK, I'll explain, then!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>First, you accept a request
from the message board.<PAGE>Next, you try to acquire the
item or items the person has
requested.<PAGE>Finally, you give the items
to the person that requested
them.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>If you deliver the requested
item by the deadline, you'll
receive a <RED>reward</COLOR>.<PAGE>Once you get your reward,
you are done with the
request!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And that's basically how it
works.<PAGE>There are three things to
remember about requests.<PAGE>The first is that there is a
deadline.<PAGE>If you go past the deadline
for a request, then you will
fail to fulfill it.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>The person who requested the
item won't accept it from
you anymore.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>But don't worry! There are
no penalties for failing!<PAGE>So don't be afraid to fail.
Go ahead and take on
requests!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>And that's basically how a
request works!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Do you want me to go over
that again for you?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Tap <RED>Requests</COLOR> on the bottom
screen if you want to check
what requests you've taken.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Now, why don't you try
taking on a request?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>First, check the message
board. You'll see requests
on the bottom screen.<PAGE>Use the <RED>+Control Pad</COLOR> to
select a request, then push
the <RED>A Button</COLOR> to view it.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>I put up a starter request,
so try picking that one!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>OK. I'll explain it again,
then.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>This is the <RED>message board</COLOR>.<PAGE>Villagers who need something
done will post their
<RED>requests</COLOR> here.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>To read the requests, just
stand in front of the board
and press the <RED>A Button</COLOR>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I hope you'll take on some
requests when you have the
opportunity.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Yes, please.
 No thanks, I got it.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>That's the way! That's how
you accept a request!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>For the request you just
accepted, the <RED>requester</COLOR> is
<RED>Ina</COLOR>... That's me, of course.<PAGE>And just like it's written
on the request, I want to
explain something to you.<PAGE>So, let's go back to
your farm now.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>The second thing to remember
is how to deliver the item
to the requester.<PAGE>First, after taking on the
request, get the item and
put it in your bag.<PAGE>Next, talk to the requester,
and they'll ask if you want
to talk about the request.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>After that, a screen will
appear where you can give
the requester their item.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>After you've delivered the
items requested, you'll
receive a <RED>reward</COLOR>.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>This is the final thing
to remember, and it's
important!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>If your bag is full...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>...You'll be forced to <RED>throw
away one of your items</COLOR>, or
<RED>lose your reward</COLOR>!<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>You wouldn't want to lose
the reward you worked so
hard for, would you?<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>So make sure you have room
for your reward when you go
to fulfill a request!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_INA><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Let me explain the basics of
requests to you. Do you want
to hear it?
