<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>Hmm...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Oh, sorry. I was just
thinking about something.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, it's nothing big. A
friend of mine who lives in
the city is getting married.<PAGE>He's really done a lot for
me over the years, so I
wanted to help him out.<PAGE>His fiancÂ†e likes pink, so I
thought I'd make a bouquet
using mainly pink and white.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>But I'm not sure what flower
I should use to accent the
bouquet. 
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> How about pink roses?
 Gerberas would be great!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>I want to offset the
rest of the bouquet...<PAGE>If I use flowers of the
same color, they'll
just get lost in it.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>Hmm... Sorry I wasn't much
fun today...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>I'm going to head home
now. See you.

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Wow, you think so?<PAGE>I was actually thinking I
should use gerberas...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>If you think so too,
then gerberas must
be the right choice.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_CAM><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thanks, <MYNAME>.
I always value
your opinion!<PAGE>I'll go home and
start working on
that bouquet, then.<PAGE>Thanks for hanging out
with me today.
See you later!
