<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>*Yawn*...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh, pardon me.
I haven't been getting
enough sleep recently.<PAGE>I'm writing a song, but it's
not coming out the way I had
in mind.<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>So I find myself staying
up late into the night...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<CHOICE_AB> Could I help in some way?
 Maybe you lack talent...?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Oh? You'd like to offer your
assistance?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_RIGHT>Thank you. That's very
generous.<PAGE>I think I will take you up
on your offer.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHY><FP_RIGHT>The question is...help in
what way?<PAGE>Hmmm.
Well, here's an idea...<PAGE><FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>I'd appreciate it if you'd
find some sound that can
inspire me.<PAGE>A loud sound, a soft sound,
a weird sound, a painful
sound...any sound at all.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_RIGHT>Hmm?
You thought of one?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>This bell?
Come to think of it, I've
never heard it rung.<PAGE>But how do we ring it?
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SHY><FP_LEFT>Sometimes you really do the
most surprising things...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I've got it...
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>That musical phrase that
just wouldn't come to me!
It's miraculous!<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>Now I feel as though I can
finish my song.<PAGE><FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_HAPPY><FP_LEFT>Thank you, <MYNAME>!<PAGE>Incredible how it came
to me so easily now...
I'm so glad I talked to you!
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_LEFT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_NORMAL><FP_LEFT>I've got to get back and
write that song right away.
See you later, <MYNAME>.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_ANGRY><FP_RIGHT>How could you think that?
What a rude thing to say!

----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>Your voice seems to grate
on my ears today, disturbing
my harmony.
----------------------------|----------------------------------
<FACE_POS_RIGHT><FACE_MIKHAIL><FACE_SAD><FP_RIGHT>I'm sorry, but I will be
going home now.
Goodbye, <MYNAME>.
